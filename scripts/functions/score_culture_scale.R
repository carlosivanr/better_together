# Score Practice Culture Scale %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Carlos Rodriguez, PhD. CU Anschutz Dept. of Family Medicine
#
# Description:
# This function calculates subscores for the practice culture scale in the PATHWEIGH
# practice member survey data. The practice culture scale is a 22 item scale 
# designed to measure:
# 1) Improvement and Change Culture
#     - 1, 6:9, 13:14, 16:17, 20
#     - Scoring: 25*((q1 + q6 + q7 + q8 + q9 + q13 + q14 +q16 + q17 + q20) -10)/10

# 2) Work Relationships
#     - 2:3, 5, 11:12, 15, 21:22
#     - Scoring: 25*((q2 + q3 + q5 + q11 + q12 + q15 + q21 + q22) â€“ 8) /8

# 3) Chaos
#     - 4, 10, 18:19
#     - Scoring:  25*((q4 + q10 + (6-q18) + q19) - 4)/4
#     - N.b.: Item 18 (stability) is reverse scored

# Inputs: pre-processed redcap data download
# Output: returns a data frame
